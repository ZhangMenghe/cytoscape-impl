On the left side of the window that pops up, you will see app folders labeled Currently Installed and Available for Install. Double-clicking on these will show sub-folders, and then the apps themselves. To find out more about a specific app, click on its name to display some basic information on the right-hand side of the window. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/small_manager.png" alt="attachment:small_manager.png"></span> </p></li></ul></div><p>The Currently Installed folder contains a number of default apps that are fully integrated in every copy of Cytoscape, as well as any additional installed apps. In contrast, the Available for Install folder displays apps that may be installed. To install and use these apps, click on the file name and then click on the Install button at the bottom of the window. A license agreement may appear, in which case you must accept it in order to download the app. You will then see a progress bar as the app is automatically downloaded and installed into your current version of Cytoscape. The progress bar will disappear when the download is complete. Other apps can then be downloaded, or the manager can be closed by clicking the Close button. </p><p>Once a new app is added, it can immediately be used. Closing and restarting Cytoscape is not required. For example, installing the MCODE app will automatically result in new menu options such as Apps &#8594; MCODE &#8594; Start MCODE. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span> </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If an installation error appears, automatic installation of the app may not be supported. To manually install the app, go to the Cytoscape apps page (<a href="http://cytoscape.org/apps25/index.php" target="_top">http://cytoscape.org/apps25/index.php</a>), scroll down to find the app, click on the appropriate link to download the file, and then save it in the <code class="code">Cytoscape/apps</code> folder on your hard drive. </p></li><li>If the new app does not automatically work, you may need to restart Cytoscape. </li><li>If the app does not appear in the Currently Installed folder of the App Manager, then Cytoscape was unable to load the app. Your command line will display the error message generated. </li></ul></div><p></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Delete Existing Apps"></a>Delete Existing Apps</h3></div></div></div><p>To delete an existing app, go to the App Manager at Apps &#8594; Manage Apps, click on the appropriate app once to select it, and then click the Delete button at the bottom of the manager. It is best to avoid deleting core apps, as this may cause Cytoscape or other apps to malfunction. A app will be completely deleted after you have restarted Cytoscape. </p><p></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Update Existing Apps"></a>Update Existing Apps</h3></div></div></div><p>Going to Apps &#8594; Update Apps will result in Cytoscape automatically accessing the Internet to look for updated versions of the apps you have installed. If newer versions are available, Cytoscape will then display the available updates in the App Manager; otherwise, it will inform you that there are no updatable apps. When multiple updates are detected, you will have the option to download some or all of the updates. Some updates may require re-accepting the license before the download will begin. All updates require Cytoscape to be restarted in order for the update to be fully installed. After clicking the Update All or Update Selected buttons, a progress bar will appear showing the status of the download; it will disappear once the update is complete, and the App Manager can then be closed by clicking the Close button. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The Update All button will update all listed apps to the newest available version. If you prefer a different version, select the name and click Update Selected. </p><p></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Download Apps from a Custom Site"></a>Download Apps from a Custom Site</h3></div></div></div><p>The App Manager automatically connects to the Cytoscape website and the sites of registered Cytoscape apps to check for and download any available apps and updates. To change this setting, open the App Manager (by going to Apps &#8594; Manage Apps) and click the Change Download Site button. You will be asked to choose a site from a preset list of bookmarks. Select one and click Ok. Alternatively, click the Add Site button to open the Bookmark Manager and modify the list of bookmarks. In the Bookmark Manager, choose the apps category from the dropdown list, and then add/edit/delete URLs using the appropriate buttons on the right-hand side of the window. After the correct site is selected, set it as the download site by clicking OK. The App Manager will refresh using that site. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Custom download sites added from the App Manager will not be saved when you exit Cytoscape. </p></div></div></body></html>
