yFiles is a yWorks commercial software product, and its source code is not open to
the public. Cytoscape distributes an obfuscated yFiles jar.

If you are a member of the Cytoscape core development team and would like to access
the Cytoscape code that interfaces with the yFiles library, you can access the
private SVN repository here:
